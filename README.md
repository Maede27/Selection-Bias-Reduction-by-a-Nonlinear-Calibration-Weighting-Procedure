# Selection-Bias-Reduction-by-a-Nonlinear-Calibration-Weighting-Procedure
In the most surveys the selected sample is not representing the target population. Sampling
not covered in frame and selection error occurs. Other reason to create bias in the estimation,
is non-response. Non-response is a nonsampling error and occurs when some respondents do
not answer to all or part of the survey questions. These two types of non-response are called
unit non-response and item non-response, respectively. One of the ways to reduce the undesirable
effects caused by the unit non-response bias and the selection bias is adjusting. In
this project, the various methods of weighting to the variables including calibration estimators
are introduced.These estimators are classified into two classes: the linear and nonlinear
estimator, and their advantages and deficiencies of each are studied. Finally, as an application
of the mentioned methods, the rural household income and expenditure survey data set is
used to compare generalized regression estimator, raking and logit(l,u) estimators. This comparison
is based on two criteria: absolute relative bias and root relative mean square error.
The results of the study show that if the population-based method is used, the generalized
regression estimator has better performance in all cases.
